# Doctor_Visit_Analysis

This Project focuses on analyzing and summarizing information related to doctor visits using the Python programming language. The project aims to extract insights from the data to gain a better understanding of various aspects of doctor visits.To begin the analysis, the project involves importing relevant Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, numerical computations, and visualizations respectively. The dataset, containing information about doctor visits, is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.The project then proceeds with data cleaning and preprocessing tasks. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data types to ensure the data is in a suitable format for analysis. Additionally, data outliers and inconsistencies may be addressed during this stage to improve the overall quality of the dataset.

Once the data is prepared, the project moves on to exploratory data analysis (EDA). This step involves examining the dataset's characteristics, distributions, and relationships between variables. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts are utilized to gain insights into factors such as patient demographics, visit frequency, appointment cancellations, or wait times.

Following the EDA, the project focuses on more specific analyses depending on the objectives. For example, investigate factors affecting appointment no-show rates by exploring correlations between variables. Alternatively, it could assess the impact of specific treatments or medications on patient outcomes by comparing treatment groups and analyzing relevant metrics.

Finally, the project concludes with a summary of the key findings and insights derived from the data analysis. This summary includes actionable recommendations for healthcare providers, insights on patient behavior, or identification of areas for improvement in the healthcare system. The findings can be presented in the form of visualizations, statistical summaries, and concise narratives.

The purpose of this doctor visit analysis project is to analyze and gather insights from a dataset of patient visits to a healthcare facility. The analysis will concentrate on gaining a better knowledge of many elements of the visits, such as patient demographics, medical conditions, treatments delivered, and outcomes. In order to improve patient care and optimize healthcare processes, it is necessary to discover patterns, trends, and factors that contribute to favorable or poor outcomes.

**RESULTS**
The analysis included finding the total number of people based on illness count, analyzing individual columns like illness, visits, age, income, and reduced, visualizing and analyzing the minimum, maximum, and median income of patients. The analysis also included finding the number of days of reduced activity for males and females due to illness separately and checking for missing values using a heatmap. Additionally, the analysis included determining the correlation between variables in the dataset and how the income of patients affects the number of visits to the doctor. The distribution of different age groups for visits and the percentage of people with government health insurance due to low income, old age, and private health insurance were also analyzed. The results provide insights into various aspects of the dataset and can guide further analysis and decision-making in healthcare.
